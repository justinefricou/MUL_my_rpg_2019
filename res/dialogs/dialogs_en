notes_check01 Let's check out the notes they gave me...
notes_check02 It says I should start by talking to the policeman
notes_check03 who has already started to work on the case.
notes_check04 Then, the photographer. He is the one who
notes_check05 found the body. He could be of great help.
notes_check06 Finally, it says the logger is the main suspect.
notes_check07 Apparently he has been in a quarrel with the
notes_check08 victim for several months...
notes_check09 Well then, let's go find them !
photographer01 Hello ! So you're the detective who's working on the case ?
photographer02 I was near the crime scene when it happened. I was taking
photographer03 photos of the beautiful forest and its flora when I heard
photographer04 screams. Several people, male and female voices, I'd say.
photographer05 Before that, there had been the sound of a chainsaw for, maybe, an hour ?
photographer06 Probably the logger cutting some trees, as usual...
photographer07 Anyway, I digress...
photographer08 When I heard the screams and then the chainsaw stopping,
photographer09 I went to see what was happening.
photographer10 Well... That's the worst thing I have ever saw.
photographer11 Here it was, the campsite's owner, cut in half...
photographer12 There was no one else. I went directly to the police.
photographer13 That's all I can tell you.
logger01 Hello, I don't think I know you ? I'm Jack.
logger_answer01 I'm detective Allen.
logger_answer02 Are you a lumberjack ?
logger02 Ho... yes.
logger03 So you're here to question me, right ?
logger04 Well, I am innocent, and I don't know who the murderer is.
logger05 That's all you'll hear from me.
logger06 I'm sick of all these questions, all day, every day.
logger07 Okay, okay, I'll talk to you...
logger08 I didn't kill him, but it was indeed my chainsaw
logger09 that was used. Someone must have stolen it from
logger10 me, let it turned on and then used it as
logger11 a weapon so people would think I was cutting
logger12 wood, saw him and killed him.
logger13 But that's not true... I wouldn't hurt a fly...
logger14 I swear !
logger15 Ho, it's you again ?
logger_answer03 Do you know Matt ?
logger16 Matt ? Of course ! He's a very good friend of mine.
logger17 Is it the policeman who told you about him ?
logger18 I heard he believes Matt is the murderer...
logger19 What an idiot !
logger20 Matt would never do such a terrible thing.
logger21 And event if he could...
logger22 He would have used MY chainsaw to kill someone
logger23 in MY forest ? He's not stupid, he would have
logger24 known people would suspect me.
logger25 We are allies, he wouldn't do that to me.
logger_answer04 Allies ?
logger_26 Yes, you haven't heard about it ?
logger_27 The campsite's owner and the shop's owner both
logger_28 want to destroy the forest so they can expand
logger_29 their businesses.
logger_30 I, as a lumberjack, and Matt, as a nature
logger_31 photographer, want to preserve the forest.
logger_32 Now, leave me alone, I have things to do.
policeman01 Oh, hello !
policeman02 You must be private investigator Allen ? I was waiting for you.
policeman03 I've already started working on the case,
policeman04 and what I'm sure of is that...
policeman05 Jack, the logger, didn't do it.
policeman_answer01 Then who did ?
policeman06 Well...
policeman07 I Think Matt, the one who discovered the body, did it.
policeman_answer02 How do you know ?
policeman08 Hum, to be honest, I'm not completely sure of it.
policeman09 But I think Matt, the one who discovered the body,
policeman10 is the murderer.
policeman_answer03 Any proof ?
policeman11 Well, not really, no...
policeman12 But he really loves this forest.
policeman13 And the campsite's owner wanted it gone so he
policeman14 could expand his campsite.
policeman15 I think he killed him to preserve the forest
policeman16 and so he could go on, photographing the nature.
policeman17 Then he went directly to the police
policeman18 so that no one would suspect him !
policeman19 Oh, hello again !
policeman20 Did you make any progress ?
policeman21 Great, great ! We rely on you !
policeman22 Don't worry, you'll end up finding
policeman23 something interesting.
policeman24 Just make sure you talk to everyone
policeman25 so you don't miss anything !
policeman26 I have some news for you.
policeman27 I have been looking through the dead's
policeman28 belongings to see if I could find
policeman29 anything to help us. Something like,
policeman30 maybe, threatening letters or other
policeman31 clues...
policeman32 Well, I found some disturbing letters
policeman33 hidden under his bed.
policeman34 Letters sent by Mr Bezoz, saying they should
policeman35 get rid of any 'difficulty' preventing them
policeman36 from expanding their businesses. In the last
policeman37 letter, he says they should start
policeman38 taking actions 'in a few days'...
policeman39 That last letter dates back to a week ago.
policeman40 I don't know about you, but I think I
policeman41 know what difficulties they were talking
policeman42 about...
policeman43 This is very concerning. I sure hope
policeman44 that Matt's and Jack's lives are not in
policeman45 danger...
policeman46 Maybe they are safe now that Rob is dead ?
ceo01 What do you want ?
ceo02 I am a busy man, I can't talk to you right now.
ceo03 You will have to schedule an appointement with
ceo04 my secretary. She's right there...
ceo05 You again ? I told you, come back later !
ceo06 Sigh...
ceo07 What do you want ? And be quick !
ceo_answer01 I'm private investigator Allen
ceo08 What ?!? You're the private investigator ?!?
ceo09 I won't talk to you without my lawyer.
ceo10 No need to insist, I said I wouldn't talk to you.
ceo11 Are you serious ? Leave me alone !!!
ceo12 Alright, alright... I'll talk to you.
ceo13 I don't know much about all of this.
ceo14 But I can tell you one thing :
ceo15 I'm not guilty ! As you know, Rob, the campsite's
ceo16 owner, and I, were on the same page about the forest.
ceo17 We both wanted it gone. We started to take legal action
ceo18 against Jack, the logger, and Matt, the photographer.
ceo19 We did it so the island's economy could flourish !
ceo20 Less forest means more campsite and more of my shops.
ceo21 And more campsite means more tourists in my shops !
ceo22 Wouldn't it be perfect ?
ceo23 So now, I'm asking you...
ceo24 Do you still think I can be the murderer ?
ceo25 Exactly !
ceo26 What ?!? Are you stupid ?!?
ceo27 Why would I kill the one person who' supporting me
ceo28 in this battle for the forest ?
ceo29 That would make no sense !
cashier01 Hello, how can I help you today ?
cashier02 Wait ! Are you the detective my boss
cashier03 told me about ? He told me not to talk to you.
cashier04 But you know what ? I don't care...
cashier05 I'll tell you everything you want to know.
cashier06 Starting with...
cashier07 How my boss is a terrible person.
cashier08 Go check the news shelf in the library...
cashier09 Lots and lots of articles about him...
cashier10 But anyway ! I think he told me not to
cashier11 talk to you for a reason...
cashier12 Yep, I think he's guilty.
cashier13 Wanna know why ?
cashier14 What ? Why ? It's your job to wanna know why !
cashier15 You're not doing your job properly !
cashier16 How did you even get the job ?!?
cashier17 I bet you lied on your resume !
cashier18 ... Where were we again ? Ho, right...
cashier19 I know he's guilty because he would do
cashier20 anything to expand his business.
cashier21 Even if it meant killing his own ally...
cashier22 So people would suspect his ennemies...
cashier23 And so he would get more land, now that
cashier24 he doesn't have an ally to share it with...
cashier25 Think about it !
librarian01 Hello, Welcome to the town's library !
librarian02 You are the detective everyone is talking
librarian03 about, right ?
librarian04 There are lots of books and newspapers that
librarian05 could help you here !
librarian06 Just tell me what you need and I'll lead you
librarian07 to the right shelf !
librarian08 What topic do you want to learn about ?
librarian_answer01 The shop's owner
librarian_answer02 The lake's monster
librarian_answer03 Nothing, thanks.
librarian09 Alright, follow me !
librarian10 Here it is !
librarian11 Take your time,
librarian12 we don't close until 8pm on Wednesdays.
librarian13 Oh, it's you again !
librarian14 Is there another topic you want
librarian15 to learn about ?
librarian16 Alright, I confess, Jack is my fiancé.
librarian17 But you must promise me to keep the secret !
librarian18 My family would make my life terrible...
librarian19 As if it wasn't already, with this murder
librarian20 and Jack being accused !
librarian21 So, now that you know we're engaged,
librarian22 I can tell you : Jack and I were at
librarian23 the bar when the murder happened.
librarian24 Of course, we couldn't tell anybody
librarian25 ou alibi or else everyone would know
librarian26 we're together ! But go ask the
librarian27 barman, he'll tell you ! He must
librarian28 remember. He's a good guy.
book1_01 This is the newspaper of the 4th of February.
book1_02 That's five months ago.
book1_03 Let's see what it reads...
book1_04 BREAKING NEWS : YET ANOTHER BUSINESS RUINED
book1_05 Everyone in town knows Donald O'Donell
book1_06 and his lovely grocery shop.
book1_07 Yesterday, he was forced to close his
book1_08 business, after months and months of
book1_09 fighting against Mr Bezoz and his big corporation.
book1_10 A real tragedy for our beloved Donald who now
book1_11 finds himself unable to pay for his daughter's
book1_12 college.
book1_13 "I call for everyone's generosity in these
book1_14 difficult times.", he says.
book1_15 This is not the first time that Mr Bezoz
book1_16 takes a little business to court to
book1_17 expand his own company.
book1_18 And it may not be the last...
book2_01 Okay, let's look at this book...
book2_02 "The monster of the lake, myth or reality?"
book2_03 Some say the monster of the lake is real,
book2_04 that they have seen it emerge, move, and
book2_05 even, sometimes, look at them.
book2_06 Some others say this is pure fantasy :
book2_07 stories told to the children
book2_08 before they go to bed, to scare them so
book2_09 they don't go to the lake alone and drown.
book2_10 So, who is right, you ask ? That is what we
book2_11 will try to find out in this book...
fisherman01 Ahoy ! How you doin' son ?
fisherman_answer01 Great !
fisherman02 Hey, now that's what I want to hear !
fisherman_answer02 Not so good...
fisherman03 Hey, don't say that son,
fisherman04 it will all work out in the end !
fisherman05 Hey son, did you hear about this poor boy ?
fisherman06 The one they found in the forest !
fisherman07 They say he was killed by one of the villagers...
fisherman08 But they're all fools ! I know what killed him !
fisherman09 It was the monster of the lake !
fisherman_answer03 The what ?
fisherman10 What, you don't know about him ?
fisherman11 He lives in the lake, and some days he
fisherman12 decides to emerge and show himself...
fisherman13 He won't do anything to you if he is
fisherman14 in a good mood.
fisherman15 But if you wake him, now that's another story.
fisherman16 This poor Rob... Jack was disturbing the
fisherman17 monster's peace with his noisy chainsaw !
fisherman18 So the monster came and killed the first one he saw !
fisherman_answer04 That's nonsense !
fisherman19 What do you mean ? You don't believe me ?
fisherman20 Well then, go and check by yourself
fisherman21 if you're not a coward !
fisherman_answer05 You are crazy !
fisherman22 I'm not crazy, you son of a biscuit eater !
fisherman23 I'm telling you, the logger had been cutting
fisherman24 trees for almost an hour,
fisherman25 the monster was tired of it !
fisherman26 Why won't anyone believe me ?
fisherman_nothing_to_say Ahoy ! Did you see the monster today ?
mother1_01 Hello, are you a tourist ?
mother1_02 I don't think I know you.
mother1_03 Have you heard about that murder ?
mother1_04 They say Jack, the logger could be the culprit.
mother1_05 Do you think he did it ?
mother1_06 Well, I don't.
mother1_07 Me neither.
mother1_answer01 I don't know
mother1_08 Me neither, but I'd say he didn't.
mother1_answer02 why ?
mother1_09 Most people say Rob went into the forest
mother1_10 and Jack jumped on the occasion to kill him.
mother1_11 But I've visited him several times...
mother1_12 And when he's cutting wood,
mother1_13 with all that noise and sawdust,
mother1_14 he never hears nor sees me coming.
mother1_15 If Rob was in the forest, Jack was
mother1_16 either waiting for him or too busy
mother1_17 to notice him.
mother1_18 Oh it's you again !
mother1_19 Could you help me ? My fridge broke !
mother1_20 It does that every summer, so annoying !
mother1_21 The air must be too hot...
mother1_22 I usually ask Jack to help me, he knows
mother1_23 a lot about these kinds of things.
mother1_24 After all, when his chainsaw breaks,
mother1_25 he has to repair it himself !
mother1_26 That's what I told Lily when her bike
mother1_27 broke 4 days ago. But she said she was busy
mother1_28 and would wait until the next day to go ask
mother1_29 him. Maybe she's shy and doesn't know
mother1_30 him very well so she wanted to see if she
mother1_31 could fix it by herself ?
mother1_32 But she's just a librarian, I don't
mother1_33 think she was able to do it...
mother1_34 But anyway, I can't ask Jack to help me,
mother1_35 He's already exhausted by what's
mother1_36 happening right now. I can't ask him to
mother1_37 help me... So, will you do it ?
mother2_01 Sigh... What do you want ?
mother2_02 I can't help you, I have to take care
mother2_03 of my children, cook, clean the house...
mother2_04 And my husband is at the bar, as always !
mother2_05 He spends his entire days there...
mother2_06 I don't know what to do anymore...
mother2_07 3 days ago, I had to go get him
mother2_08 and take him back to our house.
mother2_09 He was so drunk, he couldn't walk properly.
mother2_10 The barman had to help me carry him all
mother2_11 the way to the house ! He had to close his
mother2_12 bar for the whole afternoon because of all
mother2_13 the mess my damn husband had made !
mother2_14 Could you help ? Do you know any good
mother2_15 rehab ? You look like a former addict.
mother2_answer01 WHAT ?!?
mother2_16 Oh, sorry, I thought...
mother2_answer02 How do you know ?
mother2_17 I don't know, must be the socks...
mother2_18 Who wears green socks with pink dots ???
child01 My mom told me not to talk to strangers.
child02 But I will talk to you if you help me.
child03 My mom told me a man was really hurt in
child04 the forest 3 days ago. She says it was the
child05 monster of the lake who did it !
child06 But I like the forest. I want to go play there
child07 like I used to. But my mom won't let me.
child08 Please tell her the monster of the lake will
child09 not hurt me !
barman01 Hey you !
barman02 You're the private investigator, right ?
barman03 You should be happy that I'm here !
barman04 As a barman, I see lots of people
barman05 and I hear a lot of stories.
barman06 I bet I have some uselful informations for you !
barman07 Come on, ask me anything !
barman_answer01 The fisherman
barman08 Oh yeah, him...
barman09 He's uh... Kind of...
barman10 The weird guy of the island, I'd say.
barman11 He thinks he's a pirate and he believes in
barman12 a stupid legend about a monster living in the lake.
barman13 But deep down he's a good guy !
barman_answer02 The lumberjack
barman14 Oh yeah, that poor Jack...
barman15 A shame, what's happening to him...
barman16 I know him quite well, he used to come
barman17 every Saturday evening for a date night
barman18 with his fiancée. What a lovely couple.
barman_answer03 His fiancée ?
barman19 Uuuh... Did I say that ?
barman_answer04 He has a fiancée ?
barman20 Alright buddy, let's talk about something else.
barman_answer05 Who is it ?
barman21 I don't know what you're talking about...
barman22 Alright alright, I'll tell you...
barman23 He's engaged to the librarian.
barman24 But only me and a few people know
barman25 because the instant her family knows...
barman26 All hell breaks loose !
barman27 They don't want her to be with him
barman28 because he doesn't come from a wealthy
barman29 family, like her. Sad story.
yes yes
no no
corpse01 ...
corpse02 Yep, he's dead.
nothing_to_say Have a nice day !
nothing_to_ask Nothing, thanks.
